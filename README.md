# Oba

Hey there, welcome to Oba's codebase. We're glad to have you here. If you'd like to contribute, follow the steps below:

## Getting started
### Do this first!
1. Go through our [commit history](https://github.com/dpkreativ/oba-dashboard/commits/main/) to understand how the project has evolved over time.
2. Click on the [**Issues**](https://github.com/dpkreativ/oba-dashboard/issues) tab to see the current areas where we need your contributions. If you find an issue to work on, leave a comment indicating interest. 
(_You can also create a new issue if what you want to work on isn't on the list. You can only begin work on an issue **after a maintainer has reviewed and assigned it to you.**_)

### First Time Contributor
1. Clone the project.
2. Run `npm i` in the project's root directory to install the its dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the project on `localhost`. Click on the `localhost` link your terminal displays to view the dashboard in your browser.
4. Take some time to study the codebase and understand how the different files work with each other.
5. Create a separate branch by typing `git checkout -b branch-name` and start working on your contributions.

### Existing Contributor

1. In the project's terminal, run `git pull origin main` to fetch and merge the latest changes to this project.
2. If you encounter any merge conflicts, try to fix them on your own, and if you don't succeed, contact a maintainer and schedule a session.
3. After you have successfully merged the latest changes, start working on your contributions in the appropriate branch.

## Reviewing and merging your contributions

1. Push your branch to our GitHub repo.
2. Create a pull request to the `main` branch. Make sure you tag the issue(s) you worked on. A maintainer will review your code and leave helpful feedback.
3. If your contributions pass review, they will be merged to the `main` branch.

Thank you for working on this project with us!
