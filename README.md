# Oba

Hey there, welcome to Oba's codebase. We're glad to have you here. If you'd like to contribute, follow the steps below:

## Getting started
### Do this first!
1. Go through our [commit history](https://github.com/dpkreativ/oba-dashboard/commits/main/) to understand how the project has evolved over time.
2. Click on the [**Issues**](https://github.com/dpkreativ/oba-dashboard/issues) tab to see the current areas where we need your contributions. If you find an issue to work on, leave a comment indicating interest. 
(_You can also create a new issue if what you want to work on isn't on the list. You can only begin work on an issue **after a maintainer has reviewed and assigned it to you.**_)

### First Time Contributor
1. Clone the project.
2. Run `npm i` to install the project's dependencies.
3. Take some time to study the codebase and understand how the different files work with each other.
4. Create a separate branch and start working on your contributions.

### Existing Contributor

1. In the project's terminal, run `git pull origin main` to fetch and merge the latest changes to this project.
2. If you encounter any merge conflicts, try to fix them on your own, and if you don't succeed, contact a maintainer and schedule a session.
3. After you have successfully merged the latest changes, start working on your contributions in the appropriate branch.

## Reviewing and merging your contributions

1. Push your branch to our GitHub repo.
2. Create a pull request to the `main` branch. Make sure you tag the issue(s) you worked on. A maintainer will review your code and leave helpful feedback.
3. If your contributions pass review, they will be merged to the `main` branch.

Thank you for working on this project with us!
